Project Description: Frontend-Backend Integration for Student Grade Calculation and Storage

The Frontend-Backend Integration project focuses on establishing a connection between the frontend and backend components of a web application using HTML, Python, and CSS. The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to enter student details and corresponding marks on the frontend, while the backend handles the storage of this data and performs calculations to determine the grade. 

The frontend component of the application is developed using HTML and CSS, providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface. It features input fields where users can enter the student's name, marks obtained in various subjects, and a submit button to send the data to the backend. Additionally, the frontend incorporates error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure accurate data entry by the users.

On the other hand, the backend of the application is implemented using Python. It receives the data submitted from the frontend, processes it, and calculates the sum of all the marks. Based on this sum, the backend determines the appropriate grade for the student. The student's details, marks, and grade are then stored in a backend database for future reference and analysis.

To facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, the project employs suitable web frameworks and libraries. For instance, the backend may utilize frameworks like Flask or Django to handle incoming requests from the frontend and provide responses containing the calculated sum and grade.

Once the backend sends the response, the frontend dynamically updates the display to show the student's grade. This immediate feedback allows users to view the calculated result without the need to navigate to a separate page, enhancing the overall user experience.

In summary, the Frontend-Backend Integration project ensures seamless communication between the frontend and backend components, providing an efficient system for entering student details, calculating marks, and displaying grades. By incorporating user-friendly interfaces, robust data storage and retrieval mechanisms, and real-time feedback, this project simplifies the management of student information and enhances the overall user experience.
